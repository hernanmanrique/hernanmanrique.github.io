## Between conservation and extraction: Addressing socioecological dynamics of illicit economies and opportunities for rural development in Protected Areas of the Peruvian Amazon (2021-2025)

My doctoral project, funded by the Fonds Wettenschappelijk Onderzoek (FWO), is an interdisciplinary research effort. It involves integrating different methodological approaches to evaluate the socio-ecological change brought by the rise of coca cultivation in the Peruvian Amazon.

### Research Questions
- How does coca cultivation affect socio-ecological dynamics?
- What are the long-term implications for conservation and local governance?

### Methodology
- Remote sensing analysis
- Fieldwork and interviews
- GIS and spatial econometrics

### Publications
- **[Paper 1](#)**
