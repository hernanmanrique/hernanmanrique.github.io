## Between conservation and extraction: Addressing socioecological dynamics of illicit economies and opportunities for rural development in Protected Areas of the Peruvian Amazon (2021-2025)

My doctoral project, funded by the Fonds Wettenschappelijk Onderzoek (FWO), is an interdisciplinary research initiative that combines spatial analysis, soil analysis and qualitative fieldwork to evaluate the socio-ecological change brought by the rise of coca cultivation in the Peruvian Amazon.

### Research Questions
- What is the conventional wisdom on the environmental impact on drug trafficking in Latin America?
- What is the impact of coca cultivation on forest loss in the Peruvian Amazon?
- What effect does high intensity coca cultivation have on soil's physical and chemical parameters?
- How do local communities and indigenous peoples respond to the rise of coca cultivation?
- What are the dynamics of alternative development projects in hotspots of coca cultivation?

### Methodology
- Spatial modeling
- Soil analysis
- GIS and spatial econometrics
- Fieldwork and interviews
